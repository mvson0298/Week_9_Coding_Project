# Week_9_Coding_Project

In these exercises you will write code to create a menu-driven application. You will display menu selections to the user and will write the code to add project details to the DIY project tables. This will demonstrate the use of the INSERT statement (the Create part of CRUD).

Complete these exercises as directed. If you get hopelessly stuck, please see the "Solutions" section below.

In these exercises, you will often be told to call a method prior to creating it. This is a good approach. You set up the return type by assigning to a variable and set up the parameters. Then, Eclipse can correctly create the method.
